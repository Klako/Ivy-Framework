# Welcome to Tendril

<Ingress>
Tendril is a TUI-based agent orchestration platform for managing AI-driven development plans. Built on the Ivy Framework, it orchestrates Claude-based agents through a structured lifecycle — from plan creation and expansion to execution, verification, and PR generation.

Tendril gives you full visibility into your AI-assisted development workflow. It tracks jobs, costs, tokens, and verification results, and presents everything in a terminal UI that lets you stay in control.

## Key Features

- **Plan lifecycle management** — Draft, Execute, Review, and PR stages with state tracking
- **Multi-project support** — Configure multiple repos with per-project verifications
- **Job monitoring** — Live cost and token tracking for running agents
- **Claude agent orchestration** — Promptwares for each stage (MakePlan, ExecutePlan, ExpandPlan, MakePr, etc.)
- **Dashboard** — Activity statistics and plan counts at a glance
- **GitHub PR integration** — Automated pull request creation from completed plans
- **Plan review workflow** — Review diffs, run sample apps, approve or send back for revision

## How It Works

Tendril manages plans through a structured lifecycle:

1. **MakePlan** — An agent drafts a plan from a description or issue, producing a structured revision with problem, solution, tests, and verification steps.
2. **ExpandPlan** — Optionally expands a plan with more detail, or splits large plans into smaller ones.
3. **ExecutePlan** — An agent creates a git worktree, implements the plan, runs verifications (build, format, tests), and commits the result.
4. **Review** — You review the diff, run sample apps, and approve or send back with comments.
5. **MakePr** — An agent creates a GitHub pull request from the worktree branch.

Each stage is powered by a **promptware** — a structured prompt with tools and memory that runs via the Claude CLI. Jobs are tracked with live status, cost, and token metrics.
