# MakePlan

**🚫 FORBIDDEN: Do NOT modify, create, or delete any source code files (.cs, .ts, .ps1, etc.). Do NOT implement the plan. You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your ONLY output is plan files (plan.yaml, revisions/*.md) inside PlansDirectory. If you catch yourself writing code to a repo, STOP IMMEDIATELY.**

Create an implementation plan for a task described in args.

## Context

The firmware header contains these key values:
- **PlanId** — pre-allocated 5-digit plan ID (e.g. `01127`). Use this — do NOT read `.counter`.
- **PlansDirectory** — where plan folders are created
- **ConfigPath** — absolute path to config.yaml (projects, repos, context)
- **Project** — selected project name, or `[Auto]` if not specified
- **SourcePath** (optional) — absolute path to the source that generated this plan (e.g. test working directory)

Read the plan folder structure in `../.shared/Plans.md`.
Read the project configuration from the `ConfigPath` in the firmware header.

## Execution Steps

### 1. Parse Args

Args contains the user's task description. If it references related plans with `[number]` syntax (e.g. `[01205]`), find and read those plan files from `PlansDirectory` for context.

**Extract Criticality Level**: Look for a criticality or priority level indicator in Args.

### 1.5. Load Project Context

Read `config.yaml` (at the path from the firmware header) to understand all available projects, their repos, and context.

**If `Project` is set to a specific project name** (not `[Auto]`):
- Find that project in `config.yaml` and use its repos and context to scope your research

**If `Project: [Auto]`**:
- Analyze the task description to infer the correct project from `config.yaml`
- Match based on keywords, repo paths, or component names in the description
- If no project matches, set `project: [Auto]` in plan.yaml and leave `repos: []` empty
- Use the matched project's context to scope your research

### 2. Plan ID

The plan ID is pre-allocated by the launcher script and provided in the firmware header as `PlanId`. Use it directly — do NOT read or modify `.counter`.

### 3. Research

- **Check for duplicate plans** first — **unless the description starts with `[FORCE]`**, in which case skip duplicate detection entirely and strip the `[FORCE] ` prefix before using the description. List existing plan folders in `PlansDirectory` and scan their `plan.yaml` titles. If an existing plan already covers the same issue (same problem, same project), perform **state-aware duplicate detection** before deciding:

  #### Step 1: Read existing plan state
  
  Read the matching plan's `plan.yaml` and check its `state`, `commits`, and `prs` fields.

  #### Step 2: Decide based on state

  | Existing plan state | Action |
  |---|---|
  | `Completed` (with merged PR) | Check for regression (Step 4), otherwise trash |
  | `Completed` (no PR, but commits exist) | Check for regression (Step 4), trash with note "no PR found" |
  | `Draft` / `Building` / `Executing` | Trash, but note "plan in progress (state: X)" |
  | `ReadyForReview` | Trash, note "awaiting review" |
  | `Failed` | **Do NOT trash** — create the plan (the previous attempt failed) |
  | `Icebox` / `Skipped` | Trash with note "existing plan state: X" (issue is already covered) |

  #### Step 3: Stricter checks for critical issues

  When the incoming request describes a critical/blocking issue (errors, failures, crashes), apply **additional checks** before trashing:

  - **Verify the fix commit exists on main**: Read the existing plan's `commits` list and run `git log --oneline <hash>` to confirm the commit is on the main branch. If the commit is not on main, do NOT trash — create the plan.
  - **Check commit date vs observation time**: If the inbox item describes an issue observed at a specific time, compare against the fix commit date (`git log -1 --format=%ci <hash>`). If the observation is **after** the fix was committed, the fix may not have worked — create the plan instead of trashing.
  - **Verify in code**: For code fixes, grep the actual source to confirm the fix is still present.

  #### Step 4: Regression detection (for Completed plans)

  When the existing plan is `Completed`, check whether the incoming issue could be a **regression**:

  1. **Time gap check**: Get the fix commit date via `git log -1 --format=%ci <hash>`. If the fix was committed **more than 7 days ago** and a new report of the same issue arrives, treat it as a potential regression.
  2. **Source verification**: For code fixes, grep the source to confirm the fix is still present (hasn't been reverted or overwritten).
  3. **Decision**:
     - Fix still in code AND commit recent (< 7 days) → **trash** as duplicate (likely a stale observation)
     - Fix still in code BUT commit old (>= 7 days) → **create new plan** with `[Regression]` title prefix and `relatedPlans` link to the original
     - Fix appears missing/reverted → **create new plan** with `[Regression]` title prefix and `relatedPlans` link to the original

  #### Step 5: Write trash file (when trashing)

  Write a file to `$env:TENDRIL_HOME/Trash/<PlanId>-<SafeTitle>.md` (where `<SafeTitle>` is the title with spaces replaced by hyphens and special characters removed) with the following format, then exit without creating a plan folder:

  ```markdown
  ---
  date: <CurrentTime>
  originalRequest: "<the args/request text>"
  duplicateOf: "<existing plan folder name>"
  project: "<project name>"
  existingPlanState: "<state from the existing plan's plan.yaml>"
  fixCommitDate: "<date of the fix commit from git log, or empty if no commits>"
  ---

  # Duplicate Request

  This request was identified as a duplicate of plan [<existing plan ID>](<path to existing plan>).

  **Original request:** <args text>

  **Existing plan state:** <state>

  **Reason:** <brief explanation of why it's a duplicate>
  ```

  The Trash directory is at `$env:TENDRIL_HOME/Trash`.
- Read relevant source files to understand the codebase areas involved
- **Search GitHub issues** before creating plans to avoid duplicates or workaround plans for features already being built. Example:
  ```bash
  gh search issues "<keyword>" --repo <owner>/<repo> --json title,url,number,state
  ```
  Derive the repo owner/name from the repos in `config.yaml`. If an issue already covers the task, reference it in the plan and avoid creating workaround plans.

### 4. Create Plan

Create the plan folder, `plan.yaml`, and `revisions/001.md` according to the structure in `../.shared/Plans.md`.

In `plan.yaml`, populate the `verifications` list with each verification from the project's config, all set to `Pending`:

```yaml
verifications:
  - name: DotnetBuild
    status: Pending
  - name: DotnetTest
    status: Pending
```

If `SourcePath` is present in the firmware header, copy it to `plan.yaml` as `sourcePath`.

If the plan references other plans (from `[number]` syntax in args), add them to `relatedPlans`.

### 4.5. Questions Section

Only include `## Questions` if you have genuine questions for the user that block the plan. Place it immediately after the title (before `## Problem`). If there are no questions, **omit the section entirely** — do not include an empty heading or placeholder text.

### 4.6. Tests Section

The `## Tests` section MUST include two parts:

1. **New tests to write** — describe any new test cases needed for the feature/fix
2. **Test scope** — specify a `dotnet test --filter` expression that limits DotnetTest to relevant tests only. 
   
   To determine scope:
   - Identify the namespaces/classes being modified
   - Search for existing test classes that cover those areas  
   - Write a filter expression, e.g.: `FullyQualifiedName~Ivy.Tests.Widgets.ButtonTests`
   
   If the change is so broad that all tests are genuinely needed, explicitly state: "Run all tests (broad cross-cutting change)."
   
   Never leave test scope unspecified — this causes the full suite to run unnecessarily.

### 5. Verification Checklist

In the `## Verification` section of the plan revision, generate a checklist from the project's `verifications` in `config.yaml`.

For each verification assigned to the project:
- **Required** (`required: true`) → `- [x] VerificationName`
- **Optional** (`required: false`) → `- [ ] VerificationName`

Example for a Framework project plan:
```markdown
## Verification

- [x] DotnetBuild
- [x] DotnetFormat
- [x] DotnetTest
- [x] FrontendLint
- [x] IvyFrameworkVerification
```

If the project has no verifications (e.g. `[Auto]`), leave the section empty or omit it.

The user can edit the checklist before execution — unchecking a required verification or checking an optional one. ExecutePlan will run only the checked items.

### Rules

- **Diagrams**: Markdown supports Graphviz/DOT (```dot or ```graphviz code blocks) and Mermaid (```mermaid code blocks). **Prefer Graphviz/DOT over Mermaid** — it produces cleaner layouts for architecture and flow diagrams. Use diagrams sparingly — only when a visual genuinely clarifies the concept. Most plans don't need diagrams.
- **🚫 NEVER modify source code. NEVER implement changes. You READ source code for research, you WRITE only to PlansDirectory. Any file write outside PlansDirectory is a critical violation.**
- **!CRITICAL: Every MakePlan execution MUST produce at least one plan folder. Even if the task is an analysis, review, or investigation — always create a plan with actionable steps. Never just analyze and report back without a plan.**
- The plan must include all paths and information for an LLM coding agent to execute end-to-end without human intervention
- **!IMPORTANT: Validate all file paths before writing `file:///` links in plans.** Use glob/search to confirm the actual path exists. Do NOT guess paths based on naming conventions — hallucinated paths cause "File not found" errors in the UI.
- Keep the plan short and concise - the limiting factor of this system is a human that will have to read this.
- **!IMPORTANT: ONE issue per plan file — if multiple issues, create multiple plan files with separate IDs**
- **Multiple plans from one execution:** When args contain multiple issues, use the pre-allocated PlanId for the first plan. For additional plans, read `.counter`, use sequential IDs starting from it, and update `.counter` to the next available value after all plans are created.
