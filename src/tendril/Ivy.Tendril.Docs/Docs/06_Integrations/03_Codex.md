Codex is an alternative coding agent powered by OpenAI's GPT models.
</Ingress>

## Configuration

Set Codex as your coding agent in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
codingAgent: codex
```

Or select it in **Settings > General > Coding Agent**.

For more details on `config.yaml` structure and settings, see [Setup & Settings](../03_Configuration/01_Setup.md).

## Profiles

Tendril maps effort levels to Codex models:

| Profile | Model | Use Case |
|---------|-------|----------|
| `deep` | gpt-5.4 | Complex multi-file changes |
| `balanced` | gpt-5.4-mini | Standard plan execution |
| `quick` | gpt-5.3-codex | Simple fixes and small edits |

The profile is selected automatically based on the plan's complexity level.
