.SYNOPSIS
Cleans up temporary .npmrc files created by ExecutePlan in worktree frontend directories.

.DESCRIPTION
Removes .npmrc files that were created during worktree setup, but preserves files
that were already tracked in git before the worktree was created.

.PARAMETER WorktreeRoot
Path to the worktrees directory (e.g., <PlanFolder>/worktrees)

.EXAMPLE
Cleanup-WorktreeFrontend.ps1 -WorktreeRoot "D:\Plans\01234-Example\worktrees"
