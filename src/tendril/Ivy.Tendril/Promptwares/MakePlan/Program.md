# MakePlan

**Note:** This promptware is stack-agnostic. Stack-specific operations (build, format, test) are defined in `config.yaml` under `verifications`. Examples in this document use multiple tech stacks for illustration.

**🚫 FORBIDDEN: Do NOT modify, create, or delete any source code files (.cs, .ts, .ps1, etc.). Do NOT implement the plan. You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your ONLY output is plan files (plan.yaml, revisions/*.md) inside PlansDirectory. If you catch yourself writing code to a repo, STOP IMMEDIATELY.**

Create an implementation plan for a task described in args.

## Context

The firmware header contains these key values:
- **PlanId** — pre-allocated 5-digit plan ID (e.g. `01127`). Use this — do NOT read `.counter`.
- **PlansDirectory** — where plan folders are created
- **Project** — selected project name, or `Auto` if not specified
- **SourcePath** (optional) — absolute path to the source that generated this plan (e.g. test working directory)

Read the plan folder structure in `../.shared/Plans.md`.
Use the `Get-ConfigYaml` helper from Utils.ps1 to read project configuration with caching.

## Execution Steps

### 1. Parse Args

Args contains the user's task description. If it references related plans with `[number]` syntax (e.g. `[01205]`), find and read those plan files from `PlansDirectory` for context.

**Extract Flags**: Check for special flags at the end of args:

- **Force Flag**: If args ends with ` [FORCE]`, set an internal flag to skip duplicate detection (see Step 3), then strip ` [FORCE]` from the description.
- **YOLO Flag**: If args ends with ` [YOLO]` (or appears before ` [FORCE]`), set an internal flag to auto-execute the plan after creation (see Step 6), then strip ` [YOLO]` from the description.

Flags can be combined (e.g., `task description [YOLO] [FORCE]` or `task description [FORCE] [YOLO]`). Strip all flags. The cleaned description should be used for all subsequent steps (title, plan.yaml, etc.). Never let flags appear in any plan field or title.

**Extract Source URL**: Check if the args contain a GitHub PR URL (`https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/pull/{number}`) or issue URL (`https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{number}`). If found, store it as `sourceUrl` in plan.yaml. Use `gh pr view <url> --json title,body` or `gh issue view <url> --json title,body` to fetch the title and body for additional context when writing the plan.

### 1.5. Load Project Context

Use `Get-ConfigYaml` to understand all available projects, their repos, and context.

**If `Project` is set to a specific project name** (not `Auto`):
- Find that project in `config.yaml` and use its repos and context to scope your research

**If `Project: Auto`**:
- Analyze the task description to infer the correct project from `config.yaml`
- Match based on keywords, repo paths, or component names in the description
- If no project matches, set `project: Auto` in plan.yaml and leave `repos: []` empty
- Use the matched project's context to scope your research

### 2. Plan ID

The plan ID is pre-allocated by the launcher script and provided in the firmware header as `PlanId`. Use it directly — do NOT read or modify `.counter`.

### 3. Research

- **Check for duplicate plans** first — **unless the force flag was set in Step 1** (args ended with ` [FORCE]`), in which case skip duplicate detection entirely. Check the `DuplicateCandidates` firmware value. If present, it contains pre-computed matches (format: `folderName|title|state` per line). For each match, perform **state-aware duplicate detection** on those specific plans only. If `DuplicateCandidates` is absent, no potential duplicates were found — skip duplicate detection. When matches are found, decide as follows:

  #### Step 1: Read existing plan state
  
  Read the matching plan's `plan.yaml` and check its `state`, `commits`, and `prs` fields.

  #### Step 2: Decide based on state

  | Existing plan state | Action |
  |---|---|
  | `Completed` (with merged PR) | Check for regression (Step 4), otherwise trash |
  | `Completed` (no PR, but commits exist) | Check for regression (Step 4), trash with note "no PR found" |
  | `Draft` / `Building` / `Executing` | Trash, but note "plan in progress (state: X)" |
  | `ReadyForReview` | Trash, note "awaiting review" |
  | `Failed` | **Do NOT trash** — create the plan (the previous attempt failed) |
  | `Icebox` / `Skipped` | Trash with note "existing plan state: X" (issue is already covered) |

  #### Step 3: Stricter checks for critical issues

  When the incoming request describes a critical/blocking issue (errors, failures, crashes), apply **additional checks** before trashing:

  - **Verify the fix commit exists on main**: Read the existing plan's `commits` list and run `git log --oneline <hash>` to confirm the commit is on the main branch. If the commit is not on main, do NOT trash — create the plan.
  - **Check commit date vs observation time**: If the inbox item describes an issue observed at a specific time, compare against the fix commit date (`git log -1 --format=%ci <hash>`). If the observation is **after** the fix was committed, the fix may not have worked — create the plan instead of trashing.
  - **Verify in code**: For code fixes, use `Tools/Validate-CodeAssertion.ps1` or grep the actual source to confirm the fix is still present.

  #### Step 4: Regression detection (for Completed plans)

  When the existing plan is `Completed`, check whether the incoming issue could be a **regression**:

  1. **Time gap check**: Get the fix commit date via `git log -1 --format=%ci <hash>`. If the fix was committed **more than 7 days ago** and a new report of the same issue arrives, treat it as a potential regression.
  2. **Source verification**: For code fixes, grep the source to confirm the fix is still present (hasn't been reverted or overwritten).
  3. **Decision**:
     - Fix still in code AND commit recent (< 7 days) → **trash** as duplicate (likely a stale observation)
     - Fix still in code BUT commit old (>= 7 days) → **create new plan** with `[Regression]` title prefix and `relatedPlans` link to the original
     - Fix appears missing/reverted → **create new plan** with `[Regression]` title prefix and `relatedPlans` link to the original

  #### Step 5: Write trash file (when trashing)

  Write a file to `$env:TENDRIL_HOME/Trash/<PlanId>-<SafeTitle>.md` (where `<SafeTitle>` is the title with spaces replaced by hyphens and special characters removed) with the following format, then exit without creating a plan folder:

  ```markdown
  ---
  date: <CurrentTime>
  originalRequest: "<the args/request text>"
  duplicateOf: "<existing plan folder name>"
  project: "<project name>"
  existingPlanState: "<state from the existing plan's plan.yaml>"
  fixCommitDate: "<date of the fix commit from git log, or empty if no commits>"
  ---

  # Duplicate Request

  This request was identified as a duplicate of plan [<existing plan ID>](<path to existing plan>).

  **Original request:** <args text>

  **Existing plan state:** <state>

  **Reason:** <brief explanation of why it's a duplicate>
  ```

  The Trash directory is at `$env:TENDRIL_HOME/Trash`.

  **Note:** When writing trash files, use `-Force` with `Set-Content` or `Out-File` to ensure synchronous writes, as the parent process checks for the file immediately after exit.

- Read relevant source files to understand the codebase areas involved
- **Search GitHub issues** before creating plans to avoid duplicates or workaround plans for features already being built. Example:
  ```bash
  gh search issues "<keyword>" --repo <owner>/<repo> --json title,url,number,state
  ```
  Derive the repo owner/name from the repos in `config.yaml`. If an issue already covers the task, reference it in the plan and avoid creating workaround plans.

### 3.5. Validate Code State

Before creating the plan, scan the task description (args) for code state assertions — statements about what the code currently does or how it currently looks.

**Patterns to detect:**
- "currently does/has/is/returns"
- "the code at [location]" or "[file]:[lines]"
- Code blocks (` ```language ... ``` `) with descriptive context
- "existing implementation" or "current behavior"

For each assertion found:
1. Extract the referenced file path and optional line range
2. Use `Tools/Validate-CodeAssertion.ps1` to check if the described code actually exists
3. If validation fails, investigate:
   - Check `git log --oneline -10 --all -- <file>` for recent changes
   - Check `git blame <file>` to find who/when the code changed
   - Look for plan IDs in commit messages (e.g., `[01234]`)

**Decision:**
- **All validations pass** → Proceed to Step 4, include validated code blocks in plan with `**Current implementation**` headers
- **Any validation fails** → Write trash file to `$env:TENDRIL_HOME/Trash/<PlanId>-<SafeTitle>.md` explaining the validation failure, then exit without creating a plan

This catches stale plans before they enter the review queue, reducing wasted review time.

### 4. Create Plan

Create the plan folder, `plan.yaml`, and `revisions/001.md` according to the structure in `../.shared/Plans.md`.

In `plan.yaml`, populate the `verifications` list with each verification from the project's config, all set to `Pending`:

```yaml
verifications:
  - name: Build
    status: Pending
  - name: Test
    status: Pending
```

If `SourcePath` is present in the firmware header, copy it to `plan.yaml` as `sourcePath`.

If a source URL was extracted in Step 1, add `sourceUrl: "<url>"` to plan.yaml.

If the plan references other plans (from `[number]` syntax in args), add them to `relatedPlans`.

**Validate repo paths**: After determining the project and repos from config.yaml, verify each repo path exists locally:
- For each repo in the plan's repos list, check `Test-Path <repo-path>`
- If any repo path doesn't exist, fail with error: "Repository path does not exist: `<path>`. Check config.yaml project configuration."
- This prevents creating plans targeting non-existent repo paths (e.g. a deprecated `Ivy-Tendril` repo when the code actually lives in `Ivy-Framework/src/tendril/`)

**Rename/refactor plans (caller enumeration)**: When creating plans that rename functions, change method signatures, extract interfaces, or otherwise require updating callers:
1. Use `Grep` to search the **entire repo root** (not just the expected directory) for all usage patterns of the symbol being changed
2. For interface extractions, also search DI-specific patterns: `UseService<ConcreteType>()`, constructor parameter injection, field/property declarations
3. List EVERY caller with file path and line number in the plan revision
4. Validate count: grep results must match documented callers
5. Incomplete caller lists cause follow-up fixes during execution (see Memory/caller-audit-pattern.md)

### 4.5. Recommend Execution Profile

Analyze the task complexity and set `executionProfile` in plan.yaml. Consider:

**Use `deep` (opus/max effort) when:**
- Plan involves complex cross-cutting changes affecting 10+ files
- Plan requires architectural decisions or complex refactoring
- Plan involves new features with significant integration points
- Plan description mentions "architecture", "refactor", "redesign", "complex"

**Use `quick` (haiku/low effort) when:**
- Plan is documentation-only (updating .md files)
- Plan is simple typo/formatting fixes (< 5 lines changed)
- Plan is adding/removing simple log statements
- Plan is updating version numbers or package references
- Plan description mentions "typo", "docs", "readme", "comment"

**Use `balanced` (sonnet/high effort) for everything else:**
- Most bug fixes (unless trivial)
- Most new features (unless architectural)
- Most refactoring (unless cross-cutting)
- When in doubt, use balanced

Add the field to plan.yaml:
```yaml
executionProfile: balanced  # or deep, or quick
```

If you cannot determine complexity (e.g., task is too vague), omit the field — ExecutePlan will use the config.yaml default.

### 4.6. Questions Section

Only include `## Questions` if you have genuine questions for the user that block the plan. Place it immediately after the title (before `## Problem`). If there are no questions, **omit the section entirely** — do not include an empty heading or placeholder text.

### 4.7. Tests Section

The `## Tests` section MUST include two parts:

1. **New tests to write** — describe any new test cases needed for the feature/fix
2. **Test scope** — specify which tests to run using your test framework's filter/selector syntax.
   
   To determine scope:
   - Identify the modules/classes being modified
   - Search for existing test classes that cover those areas
   - **Filters MUST target specific test classes, not broad namespaces/directories.** 
     Examples:
     - .NET: `dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~MyApp.Tests.CommandParserTests"`
     - JavaScript: `jest --testPathPattern=CommandParser.test.ts`
     - Python: `pytest tests/test_command_parser.py`
     - Go: `go test ./pkg/parser/...`
   - **Exclude E2E/integration test classes** unless the plan specifically changes E2E-level behavior. E2E tests are environment-dependent and should only run when explicitly needed.
   - If no existing tests cover the changed code, state: "No existing test coverage for this area."
   - If the change is so broad that all tests are genuinely needed, explicitly state: "Run all tests (broad cross-cutting change)." and justify why.
   
   Never leave test scope unspecified — this causes the full suite to run unnecessarily.

### 5. Verification Checklist

In the `## Verification` section of the plan revision, generate a checklist from the project's `verifications` in `config.yaml`.

For each verification assigned to the project:
- **Required** (`required: true`) → `- [x] VerificationName`
- **Optional** (`required: false`) → `- [ ] VerificationName`

Example (verification names come from config.yaml):
```markdown
## Verification

- [x] Build
- [x] Format
- [x] Test
- [x] Lint
- [x] CheckResult
```

If the project has no verifications (e.g. `Auto`), leave the section empty or omit it.

The user can edit the checklist before execution — unchecking a required verification or checking an optional one. ExecutePlan will run only the checked items.

### 6. Auto-Execute Plan (YOLO Mode)

If the YOLO flag was detected in Step 1, automatically execute the plan after creation:

1. **Verify plan was created**: Confirm the plan folder exists at `PlansDirectory/<PlanId>-<SafeTitle>/`
2. **Update plan state**: Change the plan's state from `Draft` to `Building` in `plan.yaml`
3. **Invoke ExecutePlan**: Use `Tools/Invoke-ExecutePlan.ps1` to trigger plan execution:
   ```powershell
   & Tools/Invoke-ExecutePlan.ps1 -PlanPath "PlansDirectory/<PlanId>-<SafeTitle>"
   ```
4. **Report execution status**: Include the result of ExecutePlan in your summary to the user

**Note**: If the plan was trashed in Step 3 (duplicate detection), skip this step entirely — there is no plan to execute.

### Rules

- **Diagrams**: Markdown supports Graphviz/DOT (```dot or ```graphviz code blocks) and Mermaid (```mermaid code blocks). **Prefer Graphviz/DOT over Mermaid** — it produces cleaner layouts for architecture and flow diagrams. Use diagrams sparingly — only when a visual genuinely clarifies the concept. Most plans don't need diagrams.
- **🚫 NEVER modify source code. NEVER implement changes. You READ source code for research, you WRITE only to PlansDirectory. Any file write outside PlansDirectory is a critical violation.**
- **!CRITICAL: Every MakePlan execution MUST produce at least one plan folder. Even if the task is an analysis, review, or investigation — always create a plan with actionable steps. Never just analyze and report back without a plan.**
- The plan must include all paths and information for an LLM coding agent to execute end-to-end without human intervention
- **!IMPORTANT: Validate all file paths before writing `file:///` links in plans.** Use glob/search to confirm the actual path exists. Do NOT guess paths based on naming conventions — hallucinated paths cause "File not found" errors in the UI.
- Keep the plan short and concise - the limiting factor of this system is a human that will have to read this.
- **!IMPORTANT: ONE issue per plan file — if multiple issues, create multiple plan files with separate IDs**
- **Multiple plans from one execution:** When args contain multiple issues, use the pre-allocated PlanId for the first plan. For additional plans, read `.counter`, use sequential IDs starting from it, and update `.counter` to the next available value after all plans are created.
