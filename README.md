# Build Full-Stack Applications in Pure C\#

Ivy is a modern C# framework that lets you build reactive full-stack web applications entirely in pure C# - using familiar React-style components, hooks, and declarative patterns.
No frontend/backend split, no HTML/CSS/JS - just write type-safe C# code and ship beautiful, production-ready internal tools at lightning speed.

[Quick Start](https://docs.ivy.app/onboarding/getting-started/introduction) &nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp; [Docs](https://docs.ivy.app) &nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp; [Samples](https://samples.ivy.app) &nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp; [Examples](https://github.com/Ivy-Interactive/Ivy-Examples) &nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp; [Current Sprint](https://github.com/orgs/Ivy-Interactive/projects/8) &nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp; [Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/Ivy-Interactive/projects/7)

## Simple Example

Ivy takes a lot of inspiration from frameworks like React. If you know React, you'll feel right at home. Here's a simple counter app built with Ivy:

```csharp
public class SimpleCounterApp : ViewBase
{
   public override object? Build()
   {
       var count = UseState(0);
       
       UseEffect(() =>
       {
           Console.WriteLine($"Count changed to: {count.Value}");
       }, [count]);

       return Layout.Vertical(
           Text.Block($"Count: {count.Value}"),
           new Button("Increment", onClick: _ => count.Set(count.Value + 1))
       );
   }
}
```

## Features

- 🧩 **Rich Widget Library:** Extensive set of pre-built widgets to build any app. If you need more, an external widget framework is coming soon, where you can integrate any React, Angular, or Vue component.
- 🔌 **External Widget Framework:** Easily integrate any third-party React component.
- 🪝 **Hooks:** Familiar React-style hooks for state management, side effects, and lifecycle events.
- 📝 **Forms**: Create complex CRUD forms with validation and data binding.
- 📊 **Data Tables**: Sort, filter, and paginate data.
- 📈 **Charts/Dashboards**: Build interactive charts and dashboards with ease.
- 🔥 **Hot-Reloading**: Full support for hot-reloading with maintained state as much as possible.
- 🤖 **LLM Code-Generation Compatibility**: Designed to maximize compatibility with LLM code generation tools.

Ivy maintains state on the server and sends updates over WebSocket. The frontend consists of a pre-built React-based rendering engine. With Ivy, you never need to touch any HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. Only if you want to add your own widgets.

## Tools

The Ivy.Console CLI provides a suite of tools to streamline your development workflow:

- 🛠️ **Project Initialization**: Quickly set up new Ivy projects with predefined templates.
- 🤖 **AI-Powered App Generation**: Generate applications using AI based on your specifications.
